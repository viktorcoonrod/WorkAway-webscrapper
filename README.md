# WorkAway-webscrapper
This webscrapper goes through the Workaway website and pulls out how many hours they are asking and also the link to their ad. Then it puts it into a simple text file for later use. 

1) To use this simply go to the search you want in Workway.
2) Then go to the second page and copy the url
3) replace url with yours and remove the 2 at the end on line 12
4) replace the textfile name with your text file on line 8 and 37
5) finally on line 45 replace the range with the pages you want scraped
6) run the code wtih "python3 PageScrapper.py" and wait until your hear me say "your code is done done diddly done done"

PS I also added all of the files I created with this that you can use instead but they might be outdated.
