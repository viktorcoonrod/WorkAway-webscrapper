# WorkAway-webscrapper
This webscrapper goes through the Workaway website and pulls out how many hours they are asking and also the link to their ad. Then it puts it into a simple text file for later use. 

1 To use this simply go to the search you want in Workway.
2 Then go to the second page and copy the url
3 replace url with yours and remove the 2 at the end on line 12
4 replace the textfile name with your text file on line 8 and 37
5 finally on line 45 replace the range with the pages you want scraped
6 run the code and wait until your hear me say "your dode is done done diddly done done"

PS I also added all of the files I created with this that you can use instead but they might be outdated.
